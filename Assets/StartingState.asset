  storyText: 'You open your eyes and begin to notice nothing but darkness. You start
    to freak

    out. "Am I dead?! Where am I." You frantically start move your limps and notice

    two shining objects. One a window with nothing but a space explosion and a door

    with an ominous feeling. A certain decision and an uncertain decision.


    1) Walk towards the window.

    2) Walk towards the door.'
