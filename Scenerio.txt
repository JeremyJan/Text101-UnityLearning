Begining State
You open your eyes and begin to notice nothing but darkness. You start to freak
out. "Am I dead?! Where am I." You frantically start move your limps and notice
two shining objects. One a window with nothing but a space explosion and a door
with an ominous feeling. A certain decision and an uncertain decision.

1) Walk towards the window.
2) Walk towards the door.
